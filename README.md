# What is Misdew?

A small social networking site created by Seledity (Justin). It was thought up in 2013 and has gone through many different iterations. Development on the site stopped when the community began to drift away.

There are a variety of "apps" such as Canvas [user profiles], Feed [public status], Chat [public chatroom, also has PMs / whispering in-chat], Mail [private messaging], Draw [create and share drawings], Cloud [uploading files], Alerts [site notifications], and Settings [alter site experience and security options].
