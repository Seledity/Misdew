# What is Misdew?

A small social networking site created by Seledity (Justin). It was thought up in 2013 and has gone through many different iterations. Development on the site stopped when the community began to drift away.

There are a variety of "apps" such as Canvas [user profiles], Feed [public status], Chat [public chatroom, also has PMs / whispering in-chat], Mail [private messaging], Draw [create and share drawings], Cloud [uploading files], Alerts [site notifications], and Settings [alter site experience and security options].

# How to Use

You will have to modify the code in many places to use your own keys for the upl.justa.us uploader and edit passwords for databases/etc. Play around with the code and look through it af. It isn't the most efficient but it works kinda. Also, by default the account creation "/join" requires an email. You will have to configure the email sending for your server in order for verification emails to be sent to users.

This code isn't plug-n-play and will require some work. Feel free to use it however you wish. 

The two .sql files in the root directory can be used to rebuild the two databases the site uses- mdv5.sql (the site) and uploads.sql (cloud)
