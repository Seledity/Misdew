<h1>File Sharing</h1>
Uploaded files are shared with misdew-ds.com, a separate version of Misdew.com that is connected to the main site. <br><br>
Files there are served without encryption - meaning that by default they are using http:// instead of https:// (SSL) <br><br>
misdew-ds.com is hosted on the same server as Misdew.com - it just has a different domain name and lacks enforcement of https:// (SSL)
