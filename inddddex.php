        We began as a rebellious answer to combating the favoritism and corruption of sites like <a href="http://3dsplaza.com">3DSPlaza</a> and <a href="http://socialneko.org/">SocialNeko.</a> <br><br>
        As time has progressed, it has become clear that we need a new motive. <br><br>
        Misdew will become a social platform aimed at all internet junkies alike- with similarities to that of other major social networks. <br><br>
        There are no intentions to compete against these platforms but rather to offer an alternative with a considerable, friendly mix of them all. <br><br>
        The current structure, layout, and purpose of Misdew no longer exists. <br><br>
        There are no plans for this change to take place anytime soon and there isn't a set timeline. <br><br>
        This is simply an update- a message to those who believe in the advancement of the site. <br><br>
        <!--
        To those who are curious enough to find this-
        Misdew was an amazing project for me. However, I do not feel that the community it grew up in truly
        cared of its success or the work I put into it. No matter how hard I tried to make Misdew the best,
        it would always be pushed below SN and Plaza. Misdew was a last resort. I know that I said Misdew would
        never die- and that's true, this page and domain will exist until I decide what to do with it next.
        However, I just don't know if Misdew is worth the time anymore. I spent many months at a time- years- trying to perfect
        it and ultimately it did not matter. Since I have graduated and now have to move on to adult responsibilities, this project
        may never advance further.

        Thank you to those who did use the site and stood with me. Thank you for the countless donations I've
        recieved throughout the years (even if I begged for them). Thanks for letting me have my run at a
        social network. It was great. It was fun. Thank you all.
